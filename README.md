# PyDiffeomorph

This is a translation of the "diffeomorph" MATLAB script created by Stojanoski & Cusack (2014) into Python, also providing a GUI (graphical user interface) for ease of use.

This program is primarily intended for use in research for control creation. Stojanoski & Cusack (2014) has more details on the purpose of this, including why diffeomorphic scrambling has advantages over other methods for creating control images in research. A small summary of their findings is that
